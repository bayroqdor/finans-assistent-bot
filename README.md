    report_generation.py: Handles the creation of text and graphical reports.
    family_budget.py: Contains functions related to family budget management, such as creating families and approving expenses.
    language_data.py: Stores all language-specific texts and translations.
    constants.py: Defines constants and state variables used throughout the bot.
    bot_database.db: SQLite database file where all user data, transactions, and family information are stored.
